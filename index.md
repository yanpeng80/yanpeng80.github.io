I am a Tsinghua University alumnus, where I earned my Master's degree in Electronic Engineering in 2005, under the mentorship of Professor Ding Xiaoqing. My research centered on image processing and pattern recognition, laying a strong foundation for my ensuing career in artificial intelligence.

My professional journey has been driven by an unwavering passion for utilizing AI to solve complex problems across various domains. I find immense satisfaction in creating innovative solutions and pushing the boundaries of technology.

Post-graduation, I have had the privilege of contributing to numerous startups and renowned internet companies. My expertise spans a broad spectrum of AI applications, including computer vision, data mining, computational advertising, search algorithms, recommendation systems, intelligent marketing, payment risk control, conversational bots, ride-sharing dispatch systems, intelligent pricing strategies, multimodal content comprehension, and advancements in large language models.
